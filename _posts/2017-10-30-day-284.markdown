1/ **Robert Mueller charged Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates in a 12-count indictment with conspiracy to launder more than $18 million**, making false statements to the Justice Department, and other charges stemming from probes into possible Russian influence in US political affairs. The indictment of Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, and Gates focused on their work advising a pro-Russia party in Ukraine between 2006 to 2015, laundering money through 2016, and continuing the conspiracy against the U.S. in 2017. The charges – the first by Mueller – make no mention of Trump or Russian election meddling. Manafort and Rick Gates [surrendered](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/paul-manafort-russia-investigation-surrender/index.html) to Justice Department.

3/ **Trump tweets loud noises in response to the indictment news**.

Trump continued: "....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!" The [White House added](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/white-house-reaction/index.html) that "today has zero to do with the" Trump campaign.
